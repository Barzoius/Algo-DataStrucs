Implemented operations:

-INSERT = inserts an element

-DELETE_ROOT = deletes the root

-MIN = returns the minimum value in the heap, in this case that is the root

-EMPTY = checks if the heap is empty(returns 0 if it is not empty and 1 if it is)

-DECREASE_KEY = decreses the value of node to a given value and modifies the heap to keep a correct structure
